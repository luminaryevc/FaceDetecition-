# FaceDetecition-

This project demonstrates live face detection using a camera feed. It uses computer vision techniques to detect and track faces in real-time.

## Features

- Real-time face detection using the camera feed
- Highlighting detected faces with bounding boxes
- Displaying the number of faces detected

## Technologies Used

- python
- openCV

## Getting Started

To run the live camera face detection project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.open the codes

2.run them

3. Grant permission to access your camera when prompted.

4. The live camera feed will start, and any detected faces will be highlighted with bounding boxes.
